# yt-tag-blocker

A Chrome Extension, that works on the list of tags/keywords that will be be blacklisted and removed from yt screen

idea is to load all the active thumbnails clickable in the user's screen (which will be less than 30 mostly) and get the tags/keyword lists for each link using basic web requests.
